In a probe-based qPCR, the probe releases a fluorescent signal during each reaction cycle, proportional to the concentration of the target DNA sequence. The strength of this fluorescent signal is compared to a standard curve to estimate the target DNA concentration."

Degradation negatively impacts sample quality. As a result it is important to filter and preserve eDNA samples as soon as possible after collection to prevent sample degradation."
