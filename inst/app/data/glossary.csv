PCR inhibition is identified using an Internal Positive Control (IPC)."
Interpolated data,"Interpolation accounts for missing data due to sporadic sampling (i.e., NA values) as only contiguous months are considered in calculating optimal detection periods at this time. Missing monthly detection probabilities for each species and primer are interpolated as the mean of the month immediately preceding and following the missing month. For December, the detection probability is interpolated as the mean of November and January to account for seasonality."

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR),"A molecular technique that replicates and amplifies target DNA sequences to produce sufficient copies suitable for genetic analyses. It involves a process of heating and cooling (i.e., cycling), where primers bind to a matching DNA sequence during each cycle and a polymerase replicates the DNA sequence in between these primers. At the end of the PCR reaction, the target sequence is present in the reaction in millions of copies (amplicons). In order to visualize these short fragments of DNA, the PCR product must be run on gel electrophoresis. PCR is often referred to as conventional PCR (cPCR)."

Probe,"A fluorescent-labeled oligonucleotide (short sequence of DNA or RNA) that is added to the qPCR reaction which recognizes a specific sequence on the desired PCR product. qPCR probes offer an alternative to DNA-binding dyes (intercalating agents), as they typically increase specificity and sensitivity since only target specific DNA molecules will be labelled. In a probe-based qPCR, the probe releases a fluorescent signal during each reaction cycle, proportional to the concentration of the target DNA sequence. The strength of this fluorescent signal is compared to a standard curve to estimate the target DNA concentration."

Depending on the approach, this method can result in absolute quantification within a sample or relative quantification between samples."

Reproducibility,Defined as the ability of a test method to provide consistent results when applied to aliquots of the same samples tested in different laboratories using the identical assay (including reagents and controls).
Sample degradation,"When the DNA or RNA in a sample decays as a result of improper preservation and storage due to biotic factors (e.g., fungi and bacteria activity in the presence of excess moisture and air for an extended period of time) and procedural factors (e.g., repeated freezing and thawing of DNA samples). Degradation negatively impacts sample quality. As a result it is important to filter and preserve eDNA samples as soon as possible after collection to prevent sample degradation."
