          <p style="font-weight:normal;">The structure of GOTeDNA is based on a series of interrelated attribute tables. Project methodology is centrally captured to link protocols that share identical or comparable datasets. Common attributes, indicated in bold and italics, serve as key relational fields to join tables. Attribute design uses Darwin Core (DwC) standard and the Ecological Metadata Language (EML), ensuring interoperability with broader biodiversity and ecological data frameworks. </p>
<p>
These data and metadata templates are essential to standardize inputs into the tool and they ensure the sustainability and interoperability of GOTeDNA with international eDNA initiatives. These templates prioritize FAIR data management principles, forming the foundation for compiling eDNA data. It ensures that statistical results can be separated by method (e.g., different protocols, primers) to enable comparisons of efficiency.
<p><b>Note that users can temporarily browse their local file system to view their own data that has been formatted and subject to user quality control; users can contribute to the GOTeDNA database by sending filled templates to Anais.Lacoursiere@dfo-mpo.gc.ca.</b>
<p>
Most of the terms are consistent with Darwin Core (DwC; Darwin Core Maintenance Group, 2023) and align with existing national and international digital infrastructures (e.g., Global Biodiversity Information Facility [GBIF], OBIS, Maine-eDNA, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada [DFO]). To enhance the value of the data collected during tool development, we created a data dictionary with a glossary of field names mapped to other common data standards; all  terms are defined within the templates. The templates also capture data ownership information, acknowledging data sources and supporting networking within the field of expertise.
