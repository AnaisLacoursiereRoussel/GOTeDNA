title="a statistical method that utilizes repeated sampling of the same site to estimate the true occupancy of a particular species / target in a given site. Detection probabilities can only be determined after a study.">Normalized monthly detection probability</span> using eDNA for the selected species, geographic region, <span class="definition" title="This is the def.">primer(s)</span>, and detection threshold. (A) Wedges in purple denote species detection probability â‰¥ selected threshold, grey denotes detection probability < detection threshold. Dashed wedges denote interpolated data.
