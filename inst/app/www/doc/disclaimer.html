<p>This tool intends to infer optimal eDNA detection periods only, not species spatial distribution.</p>

<p>Website managers are not responsible for possible errors in the data (e.g., taxonomic misidentification, non-specific
amplification, false negative results, etc.). Contact information for data owners is provided for any questions
pertaining to the data.</p>

<p>GOTeDNA aims to provide guidance on data trends, gaps and facilitate interpretation to help
communication, but we recommend interpreting results with eDNA experts.</p>

<p>This tool does not aim to quantify species abundance from these data, and we strongly caution against doing so.</p>

<p>Data used should cite Data owners. Reference is provided. vGOTeDNA
intends to guide the development of eDNA research and/or monitoring programs based on the observed and predicted optimal
detection period(s) for the taxonomic group(s) of interest.</p>
